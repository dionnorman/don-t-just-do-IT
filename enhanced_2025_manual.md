## Foreword: The Enduring Wisdom of 'Don't Just Do IT!' in an Accelerated Tech Landscape

### The Timeless Relevance of Strategic Foundation-Building

The core message of the 2015 manual, "Don't Just Do IT! Build the Foundations for Pedagogical Innovation Using the 12 Step EdTech Roadmap," resonates with even greater urgency in the current educational technology milieu. The central thesis—that technology integration devoid of a robust pedagogical and strategic underpinning inevitably leads to "toolishness" and the creation of "very expensive pencils"—finds amplified relevance amidst the proliferation of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and eXtended Reality (XR) technologies.

## Step 1: Strategic AI & XR Adoption - Purpose Over Platform Prowess

### 2015 Foundation
The original Step 1 established that more tools do not equal better integration. Technology without clear purpose leads to "very expensive pencils" and increased technostress.

### 2025+ Evolution
The allure of sophisticated AI and XR tools makes purposeful adoption even more critical. The financial, technical, and ethical stakes are considerably higher.

#### Key Implementation Points:
- **Establish a clear "AI & Emerging Technologies Vision"** aligned with learning goals
- **Create multi-stakeholder vetting processes** for all new AI/XR tools
- **Prioritize pedagogical integration PD** before widespread rollout
- **Evaluate AI tools for bias, privacy, and equity concerns**
- **Design transformative learning experiences** that use AI/XR for genuine innovation

#### Emerging Trends:
- Generative AI proliferation in education
- Ethical AI frameworks development
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, COPPA, FERPA)
- AI bias detection and mitigation
- XR accessibility improvements

## Step 2: Assessing AI/XR Readiness - Gauging Your School's "Innovation Quotient"
